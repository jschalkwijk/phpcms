A CMS build in PHP 

This is my personal project which I use to put in practise what I've learnerd. It's not fully done,
but I hope it to be soon. For now some things are not fully operational.

Download or clone this repository. Inside the Admin folder, run composer install, composer dumpautoload.
In the main folder and the admin folder are config files, insert your own database info etc.
Update the .htaccess if needed.
