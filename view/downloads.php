			<h1 class="center">Lightweight Responsive menu</h1>
			<p class="center large">A lightweight Javascript only responsive menu that can also be used in Wordpress.
				It has a fallback for users with no Javascript so they can still use the responsive menu. 
				The Javascript is 4kb and so are the CSS and HTML that you will need to implement the responsive menu.
				Feel free to download and use/edit to your liking!

			<h1 class="center">Photo Slider</h1>
			<p class="center large">A lightweight Javascript photo slider. It only works with javascript enabled since
			it is needed for the control panel. When you hover over the bottom of the image the controls will appear.
			Keyboard controls included.

			<h1 class="center">Risk (board game) Dice Roller</h1>
			<p class="center large">I love boardgames, especially Risk and Catan. I started making this to practise my new
			gained skill of Javascript. There are already a lot of risk dice rollers out there, but making your own is more fun;-). You can manually roll dice one at the time, or you can let the computer decide the outcome of a 100 against 80 battle. It decides for itself when to throw one or two dice when defending. I have tried to resemble the algorithm to what you would most likely choose when facing a attacker that i.e. throws a 4 and a 6, then the auto roll will only throw one dice in defense etc. You can find more about this in Javascript file. As you will notice, I'm not a designer, it's ugly, maybe I will improve it in time, but it works, and thats what counts for me.

			<h1 class="center">Yahtzee!</h1>
			<p class="center large"> This one is a real game I' currently working on, I'm now at the tedious part of doing the scoring system and trying to us as little code as possible. For the moment it will be a one player game until it's fully functional and then I will add a two and 3 player option.
